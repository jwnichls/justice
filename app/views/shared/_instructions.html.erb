		We are running a Twitter account to persuade people that the Trayvon Martin trial verdict was wrong. Please help us write tweets for this account.
		<ul>
			<li>Write at least 3 awesome tweets that will spread the word that the trial verdict was wrong.</li>
			<li>Vote for at least 5 tweets that others have written. Vote UP the best and vote DOWN the worst.</li>
			<li>Wherever you can, use #hashtags to label topics. For example #nojustice, #standyourground, and #trayvon are good ones to use when they fit into the tweet.</li>
			<li>Whenever possible, include links to news articles that support Trayvon.</li>
			<li>Please help by clicking the Tweet button on the best posts!</li>
